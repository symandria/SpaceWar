$"The best way to understand someone is to fight him,

$"By G'Quan, I can't recall the last time I was in a       
$ fight like that! No moral ambiguity, no hopeless battle  
$ against ancient and overwhelming forces! They were the   
$ bad guys, as you say, and we were the good guys. And they
$ made a very satisfying 'thump' when they hit the floor."

$"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;        
$ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,            
$ The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
$ The ceremony of innocence is drowned;             
$ And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
$ Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
